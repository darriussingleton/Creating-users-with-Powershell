# Creating-users-with-Powershell

<h1>Active Directory: Creating Users With a Powershell Script ðŸªŸ</h1>
In this portion of the Active Directory lab I use a custom Powershell Script to add 10,000 new users into our previously created Domain. I go through the process of Running Powershell ISE as an Administrator, saving a script as a Powershell file, running the script and observing User creation. From here I confirm that the users were successfully added and then I test the operation by choosing one of the users at random to log into our Client Machine remotely.

<h2>Remote Desktop Setup and User Creation</h2>

<h3>1. Setup Remote Desktop for Non-Administrative Users on Client-1</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Log into Client-1 using the domain administrator account: <code>mydomain.com\jane_admin</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open System Properties (you can search for "system properties" in the Windows search bar).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click on the "Remote Desktop" tab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the option to allow remote connections to this computer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click "Select Users..." and add the "Domain Users" group to the list of allowed users.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can now log into Client-1 as a normal, non-administrative domain user.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> In a real-world environment, this configuration would typically be managed via Group Policy for centralized control.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>2. Create Additional Users and Test Remote Login</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Log into DC-1 as <code>mydomain.com\jane_admin</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open PowerShell ISE as an administrator.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a new file and paste the provided PowerShell script (for user creation) into it.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure you have the script content available. The script should create multiple users within the _EMPLOYEES OU.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run the script.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) and verify that the new user accounts are created within the <code>_EMPLOYEES</code> OU.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attempt to log into Client-1 using one of the newly created user accounts. Refer to the script for the password.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
